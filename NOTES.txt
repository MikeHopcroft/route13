/* TODO

FEATURE: Splitting large job into multiple smaller jobs.

Combine PlanState with newHead actions list
Pull cart into PlanState (since it is copied as a parameter anyway)
Make PlanState into a class and then add copy method

x Suspend and Resume actions

Unit test for permutations

Difference between plan working time and plan score/value

Score: payload transferred / working time
    What if a large number of bags per minute ignores urgent bags?
    IDEA: perhaps jobs specify urgency levels based on time remaining.
    Want to maximize quantity of urgency transported per unit time.
    Perhaps need to factor distance out of score. Just use distance as a constraint.
        Two jobs that differ only by destination should have equal value
        even if cost is different.
    But the amount of resources consumed is important . . .

Score: payload * time on board / time

payload * time before deadline
    What if 1 bag delivered months early override 40 bags delivered one minute before

x Rethink out-of-service model.
x Permutation table generation and testing.
x Plan enumeration.

Job tuple enumeration.
Priority queue.
Conflicting job elimination.

Simple simulator.

Proposed algorithm

for each cart
    for each {a,b,c,..} subset of jobs
        create plan(cart, [a,b,c])
            for each permutation of destinations
                exclude if capacity is exceeded
                exclude if deadlines not fulfilled
                find best scoring plan
        add plan to priority queue
        add plan to each job => plan list mapping

// Greedy assign boulders
while (some criteria)    // more carts to assign, value of remaining plans adequate
    pull first plan from priority queue
    assign plan to cart
        this involves marking plamn's jobs as assigned
        marking plan itself as assigned
        removing all conflicting plans from consideration

// Backfill with sand
// Either pick carts and assign most valuable add-on job
// or pick jobs and find best cart to assign
for each assigned plan in order of decreasing elapsed time

// DESIGN NOTES
/*
Need some way to constrain new plan proposals to satisfy in-progress plan elements.
For example, if a plan involves jobs a, b, and c, and job a has already been picked
up, new plans should contain job a.

Need some way to constrain new plan proposals to satisfy constraints like planned
out-of-service times.

Need some way to track progress of jobs.

// On modeling out-of-service time

//     //   2. Dropoffs are before deadlines.

//     // The enumerateAllPlans() generator only generates plans that meet this

//         // Score the plan.

//         // It does not bias towards loads that are closer to their deadlines.
//         // It does not directly consider cart utilization (although this is
//         // correlated with transfer rate).

//         // NOTE: the scoring here is for the quality of the routing, not
//         // the value of the plan itself. Therefore, the criteria should
//         // probably be minimizing elapsed time (or elasped time doing work vs
