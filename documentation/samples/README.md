# Samples

* [Hello Route13](./hello-route13.md) - shows how to configure and run a basic simulation.
* [Route Planning](./route-planner.md) - demonstrates how to find the optimal route for a single `Cart` to perform a set of `Jobs`.
* [Graph](./graph.md) - demonstrates the use of the [Floyd-Warshall algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm)
 to find shortest paths and estimate travel times.
* [Job Assignment](./job-assignment.md) - demonstrates use of a brute-force optimizer to assign a of `Jobs` to a pool of `Carts`.
* [Staffing Generator](./staffing-generator.md) - example of a synthetic generator that produces `OutOfService` events
for a hypothetical workforce, consisting of multiple crews, each working a
specific shift.
* [Transfer Generator](./transfer-generator.md) - example of a synthetic generator that produces `TransferJob` events
for a synthetic schedule of random arrivals and departures.
